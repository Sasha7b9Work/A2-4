IAR Embedded Workbench for 8051 MSC-51 v7.20C Incl Keygen
 IAR Embedded Workbench for 8051 is an integrated          
 development environment for building and debugging        
 embedded applications. A wide range of 8051 chips         
 supported. The compiler for 8051 uses C/C++. C-SPY        
 supports RTOS-aware debugging on hardware or in a         
 simulator.

 2) Install                                                
 3) Run the 'IARID.EXE' to find your computer id.          
 4) Run the 'iarkgn_gui.exe'.                              
 5) Enter the hardware ID into the keygen.                 
 6) Enjoy!                                                 
 NOTE: We included the command-line version as well, as on 
 some computers the GUI doesnt accept the hardware key for 
 some strange reason, thus we included both the GUI and    
 CLI version for your enjoyment!                           
 Oh, and...
